systemPromptForChatLlmThread += "- Base suggestions on the conversation context and the user's apparent interests or challenges.\n";
systemPromptForChatLlmThread += "- Frame questions to encourage deeper reflection or actionable next steps.\n";
systemPromptForChatLlmThread += "- Use first-person perspective (e.g., 'How to start building my travel budget?' instead of 'How can you start building your travel budget?').\n";
